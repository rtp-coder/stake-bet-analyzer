# Stake Bet Analyzer - Chrome Extension

### Overview

Stake Bet Analyzer is a Chrome extension designed to help users passively analyze their completed betting history on specific gambling platforms like **stake.com** and **stake.us**. It aims to promote **responsible gambling** by providing insights and analytics based on past bets, without interacting with active gambling mechanisms.

The primary goal of the extension is to empower users to make informed decisions by visualizing patterns and trends in their past betting behavior. No personal data or real-time gambling activities are accessed or influenced by the extension.

### Issues with Chrome Web Store Submission

Stake Bet Analyzer was **rejected** from the Chrome Web Store due to its functionality related to gambling sites. However, the extension differs significantly from other gambling-related extensions in its focus on **data analysis** rather than facilitating or encouraging gambling.

#### Rejection Reason:
- The extension was rejected under the policy that prohibits "providing functionality on gambling sites."

#### Appeal:
The rejection was challenged based on the following points:

- **Non-Interference**: The extension does not interact with active gambling sessions; it only passively collects completed betting data.
- **Privacy and Responsibility**: The extension is designed to promote responsible gambling behavior by giving users access to detailed analytics and insights.
- **Policy Inconsistency**: Several extensions that directly facilitate gambling were approved*.
  
Despite these arguments, the Chrome Web Store maintained its decision, suggesting that other non-compliant extensions should be reported separately.

### Future Plans

If the appeal is unsuccessful, we plan to explore alternative distribution methods and possibly adjust the extensionâ€™s functionality to better comply with Chrome Web Store policies. However, we remain committed to providing a tool that empowers users to analyze their betting data responsibly.
